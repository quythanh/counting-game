# Counting to 30 - strategy game

**How to play**

In a game players take turns saying up to 3 numbers (starting at 1 and working their way up) and who reaches 30 first will win.
So we may have a situation like the following for 2 players:

    Player 1: 1, 2, 3
    Player 2: 4, 5

    Player 1: 6, 7
    Player 2: 8

    Player 1: 9, 10, 11
    Player 2: 12, 13, 14

    Player 1: 15, 16
    Player 2: 17, 18, 19

    Player 1: 20, 21
    Player 2: 22, 23, 24

    Player 1: 25, 26
    Player 2: 27

    Player 1: 28, 29, 30

=> Player 1 is the winner.
